        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Roshni Shah. I graduated from Rutgers University in May 2020 double majoring in Computer Engineering & Computer Science.
          Currently, I am working at American Express as a Software Engineer on the Customer 360 team. 
          Previously, I worked in the Customer Loyalty group at American Express, as well as Colgate Palmolive as a Software Developer Intern. 
         </p>
         <p>
          By nature, I consider myself a maker, creator and technologist. When I'm not working as a Software Engineer, I enjoy expressing my creativity through art and design.
          Whether its making a wood carving, painting a beautiful landscape, or making interactive AR experiences. My interests lie in Front End Development and
          Creative Interactions. Given my passion for technology and art, I am very excited about the Orchard program at Apple and think its a good fit.

        <h1>Projects/Experience</h1>
        <p>Through these projects I get a glimpse of the extraordinary possibilities at the insersection of Art and Technology. 
          My career goal is to work on something I enjoy daily. I love creating experiences and creating bold designs that make an impact.
          With my unique background, I want to take these skills full time with a career as Web Developer.
          With the amazing platforms and mediums at Apple, I hope to continue telling stories and sharing perspectives through Design.
        </p>
        <p>            
        I enjoy making apps and learning about new things like AI & Computer Vision. In my freetime, I like to make CSS art and I am currently learning webGL.
        At American Express, I come across new tech stacks that I'm able to pick up quickly with this skill I'm always able to complete all projects in the timeline set. 
        This includes building lots of APIs and some of the frontend websites that power the American Express Payment and Loyalty experiences for businesses and customers.
        My team consists of 10 members who I collaborate with daily and have had the opportunity to hold leadership roles.
        Some of my skills include Java, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and I continue to increase my knowledge in each of these.

      <h1>Artwork</h1>
      <p>Drawing and Painting are outlets for me. I enjoy taking inspirations from nature and experiences, bringing them to life through Design & Art. I like to create art with different takes and perspectives on it.
         Something I like to do with all my artwork is have a tech spin on it whether thats Augmented Reality or programming a part of it or learning a new technical skill to achieve my vision. 
         I like to create experiences for someone who looks at my art and create the unexpected.</p>
